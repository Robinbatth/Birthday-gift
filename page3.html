            <p>But honestly you are absolutely amazing, yeah no joke in that. You are genuinely such a positive person and I am sure whoever is around you, feels happy by your presence. If sunshine would've been a person, it would be what you see in the mirror. Talking to you makes my days less shitty. I am really grateful for you and I wish we don't become strangers any soon or it's better to say never. You are perfect in my eyes and I am not joking (actually bss je hr dooji cheez nu "cringe" nahi kahegi fr pkka perfect hojegi lol), and I hope tu avde aap nu owe hi dekh ske, because you should be really proud of yourself. Whenever you achieve something,bhaave oh hr vaar 1st auna howe ya kise event ch part lena howe, it genuinely makes me happy for you. I wish tu eda hi vdia kre and menu hor eheje khush hon de mauke daye.I don't know if you remember but apni ik vaar iss topic te gll hoi c and you said "I don't think menu koi admire krda",but I do admire you and I am actually proud of you. I hope you love yourself and be proud of what you are doing and where you are, you deserve every bit of love. </p><br>
